# Snake-Game
The classic snake game as a demonstration of object-oriented programming in python.

A simple project created for one of my stage 1 CompSci papers to demonstrate the application of Object-Oriented Programming in Python.

This is the classic snake game we are familiar with but with an added 'enemy snake' that the player snake can't hit and has to compete with for the 'food'.

A skeleton code was provided while completing this project.
